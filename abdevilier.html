    <!-- Player Introduction and Records -->
    <div class="legend-description">
      <p>AB de Villiers, also known as "Mr. 360°", is one of the most versatile and beloved cricketers in the world.</p>
      <p>Known for his innovative stroke play and ability to hit the ball to all corners of the ground, he redefined modern batting.</p>
      <p>He made his international debut in 2004 and quickly became a key pillar in the South African lineup.</p>
      <p>De Villiers is the fastest player to score 50, 100, and 150 in ODIs, breaking multiple records with his fearless approach.</p>
      <p>In 2015, he scored the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls against the West Indies.</p>
      <p>Despite his aggressive batting style, he maintained a high average and strike rate across all formats.</p>
      <p>He was equally skilled in Tests, adapting his game to play long innings under pressure when needed.</p>
      <p>AB was also an exceptional fielder and wicketkeeper when the team needed him to step in behind the stumps.</p>
      <p>He played a vital role in South Africa’s successes in the mid-2000s to 2010s, including memorable World Cup and Test series performances.</p>
      <p>Fans admired not only his cricketing skills but also his humility, sportsmanship, and team-first attitude.</p>
      <p>Even after retiring from international cricket in 2018, he remained a force in franchise leagues like the IPL.</p>
      <p>He played several match-winning knocks for Royal Challengers Bangalore and earned massive fan followings worldwide.</p>
      <p>AB’s ability to innovate on the fly set him apart — reverse sweeps, scoops, ramps, and more were all part of his arsenal.</p>
      <p>He remains one of the few players to average over 50 in both ODIs and Tests while maintaining a high strike rate.</p>
      <p>His camaraderie with teammates and clean reputation off the field earned him respect from opponents as well.</p>
      <p>AB continues to mentor young cricketers and contribute to the game through commentary and coaching.</p>
      <p>His legacy as Mr. 360° will be remembered as one of the most entertaining and graceful eras in cricket.</p>
      <p>For many, he wasn’t just a player — he was an artist with the bat.</p>
