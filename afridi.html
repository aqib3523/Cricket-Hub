      <h2>Moment Summary</h2>
      <p>Shahid Afridi, also known as "Boom Boom," was always known for his explosive batting style.</p>
      <p>But one moment in 2013 against South Africa stood out more than others — a colossal six that traveled a staggering 158 meters.</p>
      <p>It came in an ODI match at Johannesburg, where Afridi walked in to bat during a tense phase of the game.</p>
      <p>The bowler delivered a back-of-a-length ball that Afridi read early and launched into orbit.</p>
      <p>The ball flew out of the stadium and reportedly landed outside the boundary walls, drawing gasps from fans and commentators alike.</p>
      <p>What made it legendary wasn't just the distance — it was the effortless way he struck it.</p>
      <p>There was no slog, no desperation — just perfect timing and insane bat speed.</p>
      <p>Afridi had hit many sixes in his career, but this one became symbolic of his raw, unpredictable talent.</p>
      <p>It went down in cricket folklore as the **longest recorded six** in history.</p>
      <p>Fans replayed it countless times on social media, and it became a trending moment across the cricketing world.</p>
      <p>Even years later, that shot is used in montages, highlight reels, and motivational edits.</p>
      <p>Afridi wasn’t just a cricketer — he was a walking highlight machine.</p>
      <p>His career may have had ups and downs, but moments like this defined his legacy.</p>
      <p>The six was a celebration of instinctive cricket — no technique, just pure power and confidence.</p>
      <p>Broadcasters showed it from every angle, and the crowd reaction was electric.</p>
      <p>He raised his bat, smiled modestly, and got ready for the next ball — typical Afridi.</p>
      <p>Even bowlers admitted later — when Afridi is on song, there's nothing you can do.</p>
      <p>This six was more than just a shot — it was a statement, a thunderbolt in cricketing history.</p>
      <p>Shahid Afridi’s 158-meter six will forever echo in the halls of cricketing greatness.</p>
