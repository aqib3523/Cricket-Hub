      <h2>Match Summary</h2>
      <p>In one of the most iconic T20 finals ever, Carlos Brathwaite carved his name into cricketing folklore.</p>
      <p>It was April 3, 2016, in Kolkata. West Indies were chasing 156 to win against a spirited England side.</p>
      <p>The situation looked grim — they needed 19 runs off the last over, with Ben Stokes bowling.</p>
      <p>Enter Carlos Brathwaite — tall, powerful, and calm under pressure.</p>
      <p>What followed was one of the most explosive finishes in cricket history.</p>
      <p>First ball – SIX over deep backward square leg. 13 needed.</p>
      <p>Second ball – SIX straight down the ground. 7 to go.</p>
      <p>Third ball – SIX over long off. Game tied!</p>
      <p>Fourth ball – SIX again! West Indies were champions. The crowd erupted.</p>
      <p>Brathwaite finished on 34* off just 10 balls, with 4 sixes in the final over.</p>
      <p>He didn’t just win a game — he delivered a cricketing moment for the ages.</p>
      <p>Marlon Samuels, who anchored the innings with a gritty 85*, was named Player of the Match.</p>
      <p>But Brathwaite was the hero everyone remembered.</p>
      <p>Ian Bishop’s famous commentary — “Carlos Brathwaite! Remember the name!” — became immortal.</p>
      <p>It was West Indies’ second men’s T20 World Cup title after their 2012 triumph.</p>
      <p>The win also capped a sensational day where the West Indies U-19s and Women’s teams also had recent world victories.</p>
      <p>The celebrations were wild and emotional, with players dancing, hugging, and soaking in the moment.</p>
      <p>Brathwaite's 4 sixes weren’t just power — they were poetry under pressure.</p>
      <p>The performance remains one of the most clutch finishes in cricket history.</p>
