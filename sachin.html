    <!-- Player Introduction and Records -->
    <div class="legend-description">
      <p>Sachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket.</p>
      <p>He made his international debut for India at the age of just 16 against Pakistan in 1989.</p>
      <p>Known as the "Little Master" and the "God of Cricket," he earned global respect for his elegance and consistency.</p>
      <p>Sachin holds the record for most international runs — over 34,000 across all formats.</p>
      <p>He was the first player ever to score a double century in One Day Internationals.</p>
      <p>In 2010, he achieved this feat against South Africa, scoring 200*.</p>
      <p>He has 100 international centuries – 51 in Tests and 49 in ODIs – a record that still stands unmatched.</p>
      <p>He was a central figure in Indian cricket’s rise to global prominence during the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
      <p>His performances under pressure, like the 1999 World Cup century after his father’s death, became iconic moments of strength.</p>
      <p>In 2011, he finally lifted the World Cup trophy on home soil, realizing a dream he'd pursued for over two decades.</p>
      <p>He was often the lone warrior in a struggling Indian lineup in his early career.</p>
      <p>Despite being a batsman, Sachin picked over 200 wickets with his deceptive spin bowling.</p>
      <p>His farewell speech in 2013 at Wankhede Stadium left the entire cricketing world emotional.</p>
      <p>He received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 2014 – the first sportsperson to do so.</p>
      <p>He inspired a generation of cricketers, including Virat Kohli, who once said Sachin was the reason he started playing cricket.</p>
      <p>Even post-retirement, Sachin continues to contribute through mentorship and philanthropic activities.</p>
      <p>His humility, discipline, and devotion to the game are as legendary as his records.</p>
      <p>For cricket lovers across the world, Sachin isn't just a player — he is an emotion, a symbol of dedication and excellence.</p>
