      <h2>Match Summary</h2>
      <p>Ben Stokes’ 135 not out at Headingley in 2019 is regarded as one of the greatest Test innings of all time.</p>
      <p>England was chasing a mammoth 359 against Australia to stay alive in the Ashes series.</p>
      <p>At one point, England was 286/9, still needing 73 runs to win with only one wicket remaining.</p>
      <p>Stokes, already on a brilliant 60+, turned into a beast of composure, aggression, and belief.</p>
      <p>He unleashed a flurry of boundaries and sixes, manipulating the strike with tailender Jack Leach.</p>
      <p>With every ball, the tension grew — Australia missed run-out chances and dropped a key catch.</p>
      <p>Stokes reverse-swept, drove, and powered England to an impossible win.</p>
      <p>Jack Leach held firm with 1* off 17 balls, famously cleaning his glasses between overs.</p>
      <p>Stokes hit the winning runs in dramatic fashion, sparking wild celebrations in the crowd and the dressing room.</p>
