      <h2>Match Summary</h2>
      <p>On September 19, 2007, Yuvraj Singh etched his name in cricketing history during the ICC T20 World Cup in South Africa.</p>
      <p>India was playing England in a group-stage clash at Kingsmead, Durban.</p>
      <p>What ignited the fire was a heated exchange between Yuvraj and Andrew Flintoff.</p>
      <p>Fueled by adrenaline, Yuvraj took the next over – bowled by Stuart Broad – and did the unthinkable.</p>
      <p>First ball: over midwicket – SIX!</p>
      <p>Second ball: over square leg – SIX!</p>
      <p>Third ball: straight down the ground – SIX!</p>
      <p>Fourth ball: over point – SIX!</p>
      <p>Fifth ball: over square again – SIX!</p>
      <p>Sixth ball: full toss smashed over midwicket – SIX!</p>
      <p>The crowd erupted. Yuvraj had just hit six sixes in an over – the first to do so in T20 internationals.</p>
      <p>He reached his fifty in just 12 balls – still the fastest in any T20I.</p>
      <p>India posted a massive total of 218/4 and went on to win the match comfortably.</p>
      <p>It was a turning point in India’s campaign that eventually led to them winning the inaugural T20 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Yuvraj’s innings was explosive, fearless, and a celebration of clean hitting.</p>
      <p>The knock not only changed the game but defined Yuvraj’s legacy as one of India’s most destructive hitters.</p>
      <p>His bat swing, swagger, and timing were unmatched that night.</p>
      <p>The over is now immortalized as one of the greatest moments in cricket history.</p>
      <p>Even years later, fans revisit it for chills, nostalgia, and inspiration.</p>
